			<h1>White and red wine grape varieties.</h1>
			<p>Grapes can be white, red and sometimes pink for few muscat varieties. White grapes make white wine; red grapes make white, rose or red wines. These varieties are divided into two distinct categories: international and indigenous.<br/>An International variety is a grape variety that is grown in most wine regions around the globe, you can find them everywhere (eventually you will be searching for something different). Most of declared international varieties are French in origin (also called Noble Grapes) and it is commonly accepted that for white wines, they are Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling and for red wines we have Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Merlot, and Syrah.<br/>And what about the indigenous varieties? Well, they are estimated to be over a thousand. These varieties, also called autochtones, are strictly related to their land and can give very different results when turned into wine.<br/>Unfortunately the international wine market doesn't give these varieties much consideration and pushes them more and more into the endangered list.<br/>This article from <a href="http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/48701" target="_blank">Winespectator on indigenous varieties</a> makes the point and it is worth having a look at it.</p>

					<h2>Anfora Ribolla Gialla - Josko Gravner - Friuli - Italy</h2>
					<p>Gravner has decided to make his wines exclusively in amphorae, without using oak and without using industrial yeasts, sulfur, and even temperature controlled fermentation.<br/>Despite his technique Gravner refuses to be labelled as "non-interventionalist" as he believes that all winemaking is intervention in a natural process that leads to vinegar.</p>
					<p>Gravner's formula for this wine involves a very long time of skin contact during vinification, sometimes more than six months. Moreover, Gravner ages his wines 5-7 years in his cellar and only releases them when he decides they are ready.</p>
					<p>The result is an incredible and distinctive orange colour of this wine, complex aromatics and exceptional tannic structure for a white wine.<br/>You won't believe it!</p>
					<h3>Tasting notes:</h3>
					<p>Apricots, peaches, orange-blossom honey, flowers, and roasted nuts. Dry and medium body, good acidity. Notes of intense tangerine, apricots, hazelnuts on the palate. Good structure, signs of tannins.</p>
					<h3>It sounds like:</h3>
