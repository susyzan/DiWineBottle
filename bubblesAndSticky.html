			<h1>How do they put bubbles into a champagne bottle?</h1>
			<p>You need two fermentations to have a sparkling wine: the first one turns the grape juice into wine (that’s called a base wine) and the second one turns the base wine into bubbly wine.<br/>The second fermentation is obtained by adding a mixture of yeasts and sugar to the base wine, which is also called Liqueur de Dosage. The added yeasts convert the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide bubbles develop as natural by-product. If fermentation takes place in a closed container, the bubbles will stay into the wine.<br/>The longer and slower the winemaking process, the more complex and expensive the sparkling wine will be. Some sparkling wines are ten years in the making; others are produced in only a few months.<br/>Although many variations exist, most sparkling wines are produced in one of two ways: through second fermentation in a tank, or through second fermentation in a bottle.</p>
			<h3>Tank fermentation</h3>
			<p>This is the quickest and most efficient way of making a sparkling wine, the second fermentation happens in large, closed, pressurized tanks. Other names for this method are: bulk method, tank method, cuve close and the most popular is charmat method.<br/>Sparkling wines made in the charmat method are usually the least expensive. That’s because they’re usually made in large quantities and they’re ready for sale soon after harvest. The whole process can take just a few weeks. Also, the grapes used in making sparkling wine by the charmat method are usually far less expensive than the Pinot Noir and Chardonnay typically used in the traditional or champagne method.</p>
			<h3>Bottle fermentation</h3>
			<p>Also called traditional method, classic method or metode champenoise, the second fermentation is conducted in the individual bottles in which the wine is later sold.<br/>Champagne has been made in this way for over 300 years and there are no other ways to make it. Many other French sparkling wines produced outside of the Champagne region use the same process but are allowed to use the term crémant in their names rather than champagne.<br/>Bottle fermentation is an elaborate process in which every single bottle becomes an individual fermentation tank. Including the aging time at the winery before the wine is sold, this process requires a minimum of fifteen months and usually takes three years or more.<br/>Invariably, bottle fermented sparkling wines are more expensive than tank-fermented bubblies</p>

			<p>Next time you want to call your cheap bubbly "Champagne", think twice!</p>

				<h2>Rosé de saignée - Larmandier-Bernier - Champagne - France</h2>
				<p>In Champagne, most rosés are made by blending white wine with a little red wine from Champagne. A rosé de saignée, on the other hand, is made by directly macerating Pinot Noir grapes on their skins. This method of vinification is more demanding and requires grapes with an excellent degree of maturity.</p>
				<p>This delicious wine is 100% Pinot Noir vinified with a technique rarely used in Champagne: the Pinot grapes are partly destemmed and left to macerate for two to three days before the 'bleeding' is carried out. Then comes the natural alcoholic fermentation (indigenous yeast) in an enamel-lined steel vat, the malolactic fermentation and the maturation on the lees for about a year.
				<p>After being aged a minimum of 2 years in our cellars, the wine is disgorged 6 months before being marketed with a discreet dosage (3 grams of sugar). This is the real rosé.</p>
				<h3>Tasting notes:</h3>
				<p>This is a powerful wine with strong red fruit but backed up with serious structure.<br/>Larmandier-Bernier completely redefines what Rose can be all about with this monumental effort.</p>
				<h3>It sounds like:</h3>
